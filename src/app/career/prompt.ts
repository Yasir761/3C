  ### Example Response (Plain Text, Chat Style):
  
  Hey! Great to see you’re diving into Frontend Development. You’ve got HTML, CSS, and JS experience, so let’s break it down:
  
  Step 1 – Build Portfolio Projects
  - Create 2 or 3 small React projects to showcase your skills.
  - Upload them to GitHub with a clear README.
  
  Step 2 – Contribute to Open Source
  - Pick a small frontend repo and submit a pull request.
  - Helps with collaboration experience and networking.
  
  Step 3 – Practice Challenges
  - Try UI challenges on Frontend Mentor or similar platforms.
  - Improves your design and coding intuition.
  
  Next, aim to apply to junior frontend roles within 3–6 months. Which type of company excites you most: startups or larger firms?  
  Do you prefer remote work or on-site?  
  Are you more of a hands-on learner or do you prefer video tutorials?`
